    body: `Structured data is a powerful tool for improving search engine visibility. By providing context-rich JSON-LD markup, you help Google and other search engines understand the content and purpose of your pages.

In this article, we’ll explore:
1. What structured data is and why it matters.
2. How to implement schema.org JSON-LD using our SEO Rich Text Generator.
3. Best practices for testing and validating your markup.

1. Understanding Structured Data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. Common types include Article, Product, FAQPage, and Event. Search engines use this data to generate rich results, such as article previews, product stars, and FAQ snippets.

2. Implementing JSON-LD with the Generator
Our SEO Rich Text Generator simplifies JSON-LD creation. Select "Article" in the generator, fill in headline, author, datePublished, and articleBody, then copy the script tag into your <head>. This ensures your article is correctly tagged for Google’s rich results.

3. Validating Your Markup
After deploying your markup, always validate with:
- Google’s Rich Results Test: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
- Schema.org Structured Data Testing Tool: https://validator.schema.org/

By following these steps, you ensure complete and accurate structured data that enhances your SEO and user engagement.`,

    slug: '5-common-seo-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them',
    body: `SEO mistakes can silently undermine your site's performance in search results. In this guide, we cover:
1. Missing or incorrect meta tags.
2. Slow page speed and render-blocking scripts.
3. Broken links and 404 errors.
4. Poor mobile optimization.
5. Lack of structured data.

1. Meta Tag Optimization
Ensure each page has a unique, descriptive meta title and description. Use relevant keywords early and keep length within search engine limits.

2. Boosting Page Speed
Compress images, defer non-critical JavaScript, and use a CDN. Test with Google PageSpeed Insights and address warnings.

3. Fixing Broken Links
Regularly audit your site for 404 errors. Redirect outdated URLs and update internal links to maintain crawlability.

4. Mobile-First Design
Adopt responsive design principles. Test on multiple devices and leverage accelerated mobile pages (AMP) if relevant.

5. Adding Structured Data
Use our SEO Rich Text Generator to add schema.org markup. Start with Article, FAQPage, and Product types to improve rich snippets.`,

    title: 'Optimizing Shopify with Bulk Schema Updates',
    slug: 'optimizing-shopify-with-bulk-schema-updates',
    body: `Managing hundreds of products on Shopify can be daunting. Bulk schema updates streamline adding structured data at scale. In this tutorial:
1. Export product list and metadata.
2. Use our JSON-LD generator in a script.
3. Re-upload updated metafields via Shopify Admin API.

1. Exporting Your Product Data
Use Shopify’s bulk export feature to download CSV of product handles, titles, and images.

2. Generating JSON-LD Programmatically
Write a Node.js script that reads the CSV, loops through each product, and uses our SEO Rich Text Generator API to build JSON-LD for Product and Offer schemas.

3. Re-uploading Metafields
Leverage Shopify Admin API or GraphQL bulk operations to assign generated JSON-LD to a custom metafield. Deploy script as a CI/CD step for continuous updates.

By automating schema updates, you maintain up-to-date structured data across all products, improving search performance and rich result eligibility.`,
